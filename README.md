# CodSoft Task 2: MediScan Rural India Landing Page

## Project Overview
[cite_start]A product-focused landing page for **MediScan Rural India**, an AI diagnostic tool designed to improve healthcare accessibility in underserved regions[cite: 22].

## Technical Features
- **Three-Column Grid**: Utilizes **CSS Grid** to organize core research pillars—Multi-disease detection, MRI synthesis, and Academic excellence—into a responsive layout.
- [cite_start]**AI Integration**: Features a direct Call-to-Action (CTA) linking to the live **Hugging Face** space where the Vision Transformer models are hosted[cite: 22].
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Implements a high-contrast palette (Deep Navy and Electric Cyan) and glassmorphism-inspired cards for a "Deep Tech" feel.

## Research Background
The information presented is derived from my ongoing work on:
- [cite_start]**MRI Cyclic Conversion**: Using Cycle GANs and Shared Latent Diffusion[cite: 18].
- [cite_start]**Vision Transformers**: Specifically trained to detect 6 different varied diseases[cite: 22].

## Technical Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic document structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Grid Layout, and Flexbox for precise alignment.
